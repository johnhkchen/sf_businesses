  "description": "<strong>NEW!</strong>: Use the new <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/k6sk-2y6w\">Business Account Number lookup tool</a></u>. \n\n<strong>SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes the locations of businesses that pay taxes to the City and County of San Francisco. Each registered business may have multiple locations and each location is a single row. The Treasurer & Tax Collector\u2019s Office collects this data through business registration applications, account update/closure forms, and taxpayer filings. Business locations marked as \u201cAdministratively Closed\u201d have not filed or communicated with TTX for 3 years, or were marked as closed following a notification from another City and County Department. \n\nThe data is collected to help enforce the Business and Tax Regulations Code including, but not limited to: Article 6, Article 12, Article 12-A, and Article 12-A-1. http://sftreasurer.org/registration.\n\n<strong>HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<li><strong>System migration in 2014:</strong> When the City transitioned to a new system in 2014, only active business accounts were migrated. As a result, any businesses that had already closed by that point were not included in the current dataset.\n<li><strong>2018 account cleanup:</strong> In 2018, TTX did a major cleanup of dormant and unresponsive accounts and closed approximately 40,000 inactive businesses.\n\nTo learn more about using this dataset watch <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JO-s2j30qQ\">this video</a></u>.\nTo update your listing or look up your BAN see this FAQ: \n <u><a href=\"https://sfdigitalservices.gitbook.io/dataset-explainers/registered-business-locations-faq\">Registered Business Locations Explainer</a></u>",
